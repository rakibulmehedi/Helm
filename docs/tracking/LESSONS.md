# POCKETA — LESSONS LEARNED

This file captures engineering, product, UX, and agentic workflow lessons.

---

## Product Lessons

### 1. Pocketa should not be a generic expense tracker
Generic expense apps are crowded and weakly differentiated. Pocketa is stronger as a Freelancer Finance OS.

### 2. Freelancer pain is more monetizable than general expense tracking
Irregular income, pending payments, subscriptions, and business/personal separation create stronger product value.

### 3. Pocketa must solve forward-looking freelancer cashflow uncertainty, not just backward-looking expense categorization
Users need to know "Am I okay this month?" and "When is this USD clearing?" Tracking past expenses doesn't solve this primary anxiety.

### 4. Calm UX matters more than feature count
Finance users need clarity, not dashboard noise.

## Engineering Lessons

### 1. Foundation before features
Routing, onboarding state, Hive setup, and analyzer cleanliness created a stable base.

### 2. Small phases prevent agent drift
Phase-based development kept Antigravity from overbuilding.

### 3. Offline-first is the correct default
Local-first CRUD made the app fast, usable, and reliable before cloud complexity.

### 4. Analyzer cleanliness is a quality gate
“No issues found” should remain mandatory after every phase.

## Agentic Engineering Lessons

### 1. Agents need product brain, not just code instructions
Without POCKETA_BRAIN.md, agents may build generic finance features.

### 2. Scope boundaries are mandatory
Every prompt must say what NOT to build.

### 3. Separate planner, builder, reviewer, stabilizer roles
One agent should not freely plan, code, and expand scope without review.

## UX Lessons

### 1. Undo is better than heavy confirmation for frequent actions
Delete + Undo creates faster UX than confirm dialogs.

### 2. Filtering and grouping improve clarity before charts
Better list readability matters before visualization.

### 3. Empty states are product education moments
They should guide the user, not just say “No data”.
